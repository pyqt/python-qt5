Qt Designer is a capable graphical user interface designer that lets you
create and configure forms without writing code. GUIs created with
Qt Designer can be converted to Python code or created at run-time.

Some of the examples in this directory can be run from the example launcher;
others can only be used from within Qt Designer.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the "Tutorial and Examples"
link in the main Qt documentation.
