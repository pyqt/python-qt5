The animation framework aims to provide an easy way for creating animated and
smooth GUI's. By animating PyQt properties, the framework provides great
freedom for animating widgets and other QObjects. The framework can also be
used with the Graphics View framework.

examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
