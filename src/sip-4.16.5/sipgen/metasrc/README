This directory contains meta-source files for flex and bison.  To support
platforms that don't come with flex and bison installed we ship the generated
.c files.  We put them in a sub-directory to avoid problems with default
Makefile rules accidentally recreating the .c files using the wrong tools.

If you want to recreate the .c files then change to this directory and run the
following commands:

    flex -o../lexer.c lexer.l
    bison -y -d -o ../parser.c parser.y
