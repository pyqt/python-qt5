SIP - C/C++ Bindings Generator for Python v2 and v3
===================================================

The SIP documentation (including installation instructions) can be found in the
``doc`` directory.


Building from the Mercurial Repository
--------------------------------------

If you are using a copy of SIP cloned from the Mercurial repository, or are
using a Mercurial archive, then you have to prepare it first before you follow
the normal installation instructions.

The preparation is done using the ``build.py`` script which can be found in the
same directory as this ``README`` file.  If it isn't there then you probably
have a packaged release and should just follow the normal installation
instructions.

The ``build.py`` script requires that ``flex`` and ``bison``, and the Mercurial
Python bindings are installed.  If you want to create the HTML documentation
then Sphinx must also be installed.

To prepare run the following::

    python build.py prepare

Note that ``build.py`` is a Python v2 script.

Now you can follow the normal installation instructions.

The ``build.py`` script has other useful commands, use the ``--help`` option to
see the details.
